==============================
This is a submission of **assignment 1** for the **CIS722** course.

It contains the code necessary to conduct simple classification and regression models.

Getting Started
------------
Clone the project from GitHub

`$ git clone https://github.com/tariqshaban/machine-learning-model-visualizer.git`

You may need to configure the Python interpreter (depending on the used IDE).

No further configuration is required.

Usage
------------
Navigate to the `main.py` and invoke the necessary methods, it is expected to achieve the following:

* To view the accuracy of each model for a given set.
